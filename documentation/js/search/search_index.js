When a NavigationEnd event is emitted, the code checks the length of the URL split\n by the '/' character. If the length is greater than 2, it sets the back property to the\n substring of the URL up to the last occurrence of '/'. This will effectively remove the\n last segment of the URL and give the previous page. If the length is not greater than 2,\n it sets the back property to an empty string. This indicates that there is no previous page,\n and the back button should not be visible in the UI.\n\n                            \n                                    Parameters :\n                                    \n                                        \n                                            \n                                                Name\n                                                    Type\n                                                Optional\n                                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                                \n                                                        router\n                                                  \n                                                        \n                                                                        Router\n                                                        \n                                                  \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                \n                                                \n                                                        navigation\n                                                  \n                                                        \n                                                                        NavigationService\n                                                        \n                                                  \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                \n                                                \n                                                        menuService\n                                                  \n                                                        \n                                                                        MenuService\n                                                        \n                                                  \n                                                    \n                                                            No\n                                                    \n                                                    \n                                                \n                                        \n                                    \n                            \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        Methods\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        handleClick\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \nhandleClick(menuPoint: MenuPoint)\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Defined in src/app/navigation/navigation.component.ts:61\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    This code defines a function handleClick that takes a menuPoint object as a parameter. The\nfunction first checks if the onClick property of the menuPoint object is not null. If it\nis not null, it calls the function stored in the onClick property.Then it checks if the\nlink property of the menuPoint object is not null. If it is not null, it uses the router.navigate\nmethod to navigate to the route specified in the link property. It is called when the user\nclicks on a menu item, this function gets called and based on whether onClick and link\nproperties are null or not, it either calls the callback function or navigate to the specified\nlink. This allows you to navigate to different pages or execute some logic when the menu point\nis clicked.\n\n\n                    \n                        Parameters :\n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Name\n                                    Type\n                                    Optional\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    menuPoint\n                                    \n                                                MenuPoint\n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        No\n                                    \n\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        Returns :         void\n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        ngOnInit\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \nngOnInit()\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Defined in src/app/navigation/navigation.component.ts:77\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    In this ngOnInit method, the component subscribes to two observables: currentMessage of\nnavigation service and currentMenu of menuService.

        \n                \n                    The getObjectProperty() method is a helper method used to search for a specific property\nin a JavaScript object. It takes two arguments, an object and a search key. It iterates\nthrough the object using the Object.entries() method which returns an array of key-value\npairs. It then checks if the current key matches the search key, if it does it returns the\nvalue of that property, if not it continues iterating until it finds the key or until it\nhas checked all the properties. If it doesn't find the key it returns the search key.\n\n\n                    \n                        Parameters :\n                        \n                        \n                            \n                                \n                                    Name\n                                    Type\n                                    Optional\n                                \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    object\n                                    \n                                                Object\n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        No\n                                    \n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                    searchKey\n                                    \n                                                string\n                                    \n\n                                    \n                                        No\n                                    \n\n\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        Returns :         any\n\n                    \n                    \n                        value if the key matches, if not it returns the searchkey\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        getTranslation\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \ngetTranslation(translations: Object, key: string)\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Defined in src/app/_services/translation-manager.service.ts:32\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    The getTranslation method takes in a translations object and a key.

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\n- Code scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\n- Build\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\n- Running unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\n- Running end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.\n- Deploy github-pages\nRun npm run deploy to execute the deploy for Github-pages.\nDocumentation\nThe documentation has been created using Compodoc, a powerful open-source tool to automatically generate\nhtml documentation from comments in the Angular project. You can create your own HTML documentation using the command npm run compodoc and you will find the index.html file in the documentation folder. WARNING! Here on Github the documentation is auto-generated on every commit and has its own branch Also, make sure you follow the Guidelines!\nFurther help\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 14.2.6.
