## Setup this project:

### - Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### - Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### - Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### - Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### - Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### - Deploy github-pages
Run `npm run deploy` to execute the deploy for Github-pages.


## Documentation

The documentation has been created using [Compodoc](https://compodoc.app/), a powerful open-source tool to automatically generate
html documentation from comments in the Angular project. \
You can create your own HTML documentation using the command `npm run compodoc` and you will find the index.html file in the documentation folder. \
WARNING! Here on Github the documentation is auto-generated on every commit and has its [own branch](https://github.com/Benji377/carbon-calculator/tree/angular-docu) \
Also, make sure you follow the [Guidelines](DOCUMENTING.md)!

## Further help
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6. \
